    Spreadsheet Writer for PHP

DESCRIPTION

    Low memory, high performance library for writing large spreadsheets in various standard formats. 
    Only a small subset of features are included, which means row level styling and right now, no 
    formulas either.

    Memory: Everything is written to disk, so memory overhead is pretty much zero.
    Speed:  It's pretty damn fast! However because of the memory constraint, it's not mindblowing.

    Note: This is still only ALPHA/BETA quality.

REQUIREMENTS

    * PHP 5.3
    * ZipArchive (only OOXML and you can create your own zip compressor, if you prefer another solution)

WRITERS

    * Office Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx)
    * Microsoft Excel 2003 XML (.xml)
    * CSV (.csv)

EXAMPLE

    The following (100.000x25) example runs in ~25 seconds.

        $fp = fopen('example.xlsx', 'w');
        $factory = new DOMFactory();
        $book = $factory->getBook();
        $book->setWriter($factory->getWriterFactory()->getOfficeOpenXml2007StreamWriter($fp));

        $sheet = $book->addSheet();
        for($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
            $sheet->addRow($this->factory->getRow(range(0, 25)));
        }

        $book->close();
        fclose($fp);

    Simple row based styling.

        $row = array();
        $factory = new DOMFactory();
        $book = $factory->getBook();
        $style = $book->addStyleById('style1')
                      ->setFontBold(true)
                      ->setFontFamily('Aria')
                      ->setFontSize('14');
        $sheet->addRow($factory->getRow($row)->setStyle($style));

    Custom Compressor for OOXML

        class CommandLineCompressor implements SpreadsheetWriter\Compressor 
        {
            public function compressDir($source, $destination)
            {
                exec('zip' . escapeshellarg($source) . escapeshellarg($destination)); // most likely does not work :)
            }
        }

        $compressor = new CommandLineCompressor;
        $writer = new SpreadsheetWriter\Writer\OfficeOpenXML2007StreamWriter($fp, $compressor);
